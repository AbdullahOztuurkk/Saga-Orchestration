## Saga Orchestration

Saga orchestration is a pattern used in distributed systems for managing long-lived transactions that span multiple services or components. It involves coordinating a sequence of actions or compensating actions to ensure the consistency of data across these distributed systems.

### Key Concepts:

- **Atomicity**: Sagas ensure that either all the steps in a transaction are completed successfully or, if a failure occurs, appropriate compensating actions are taken to revert the changes made by the preceding steps.
  
- **State Management**: Sagas maintain state information to track the progress of the transaction and determine which actions need to be performed next.

- **Compensating Actions**: If a failure occurs during the execution of a saga, compensating actions are executed to undo the changes made by previous steps, ensuring that the system returns to a consistent state.

### Benefits:

- **Scalability**: Sagas allow distributed transactions to be broken down into smaller, more manageable units of work, which can be executed independently and in parallel, leading to better scalability.

- **Fault Tolerance**: By incorporating compensating actions, sagas provide resilience against failures, ensuring that transactions can recover from errors without leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

- **Flexibility**: Sagas enable complex business processes to be modeled and executed in a distributed environment, offering flexibility in designing workflows that span multiple services.
